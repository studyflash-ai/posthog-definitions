/**
 * Spec for the per-project (environment) settings singleton.
 *
 * Field types come straight from the OpenAPI schema (`PatchedProjectBackwardCompat`) with the
 * server-managed identifiers, tokens, and computed fields omitted. Every key
 * is optional: the field-scoping invariant is that we only PATCH the keys the
 * user explicitly declares, and never touch the rest.
 *
 * If you previously set a field and want to stop managing it, simply remove
 * the key from the spec — the server value will persist (we don't have
 * before-state to roll back to). To reset a field, declare it with the value
 * you want.
 *
 * `null` and "missing" are distinct: `field: null` PATCHes the field to null;
 * omitting the key entirely leaves the server value alone.
